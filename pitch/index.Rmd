## Triathlete country distribution (with plotly)
```{r echo=F, opts.label = 'interactive', results = 'asis', dpi=67}
library(plotly)
triathletes <- readRDS("assets/data/triathletes2016.rds")
pietri <- triathletes %>%
      group_by(Nationality) %>%
      summarise(count = n()) %>%
      plot_ly(labels = ~Nationality, values = ~count,textinfo = "none") %>%
      add_pie(hole = 0.6) %>%
      layout(title = "Country Ring of Triathletes",  showlegend = T,
             xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
             yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))
pietri
```

## Distribution of triathletes (Age and BMI)
```{r echo=F, opts.label = 'interactive', results = 'asis'}
p <- plot_ly(alpha = 0.6) %>%
  add_histogram(x = ~triathletes$BMI,  name = 'Nationality') %>%
  add_histogram(x = ~triathletes$Age,name = 'Age') %>%
  layout(barmode = "overlay") 
p
```

## Scatterplot of normal person vs super triathlete

```{r echo=F, opts.label = 'interactive', results = 'asis', dpi=70}
p <- plot_ly(triathletes, x = ~Age, y = ~BMI, name = 'Olympic Triathletes', 
      type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers') %>%
    add_trace(y = 25, name = 'Normal Dude', mode = 'lines')
p
```
